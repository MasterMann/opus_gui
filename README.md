# Opus GUI
A GUI to process music files into Opus.

I wrote this software to convert my FLAC music collection to the Opus format.

The software comes bundled with the Opus encoder. You will need to download ffmpeg if it is not in your system.

You can get updated Opus Tools builds at my site here: [https://moisescardona.me/opusenc-builds/](https://moisescardona.me/opusenc-builds/).

Written in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio 2017.

By default, non-compatible files are copied to the output folder. You can make an "ignore.txt" file to ignore certain file types from being copied. Just add the file types like ".accurip", ".cue", etc and they will not be copied. FLACs and WAVs will be encoded.

Enjoy!
